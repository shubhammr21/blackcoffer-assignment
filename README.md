# Blackcoffer Assignment

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application consisting of a Django backend and a modern frontend (React + Vite + TypeScript). The backend provides APIs for data management, while the frontend offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with the data, including charts and tables.

## Getting Started

This repository contains both the backend and frontend applications. To run the project, please refer to the detailed instructions provided in the respective directories:

- **Backend setup and usage:** See [`backend/README.md`](./backend/README.md)
- **Frontend setup and usage:** See [`frontend/README.md`](./frontend/README.md)

Each README includes prerequisites, installation steps, and commands to run the development servers.
